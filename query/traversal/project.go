package traversal

// Project (map) projects the current object into a Map<string, object> keyed
// by provided labels. It is similar to Select(), save that instead of retrieving
// and modulating historic traverser state, it modulates the current state of the traverser.
// Signatures:
// Project(string, ...string)
